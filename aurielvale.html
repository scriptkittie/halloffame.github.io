                            <p>Auriel Vale is an anxious, shy druid who prefers being out in the wild and the company of animals. She’s so quiet that some adventurers think she’s casting spells, but she’s just mumbling to herself about mushrooms. </p>
                            <p>When she casts Guidance on herself, she screams like a Viking at a rock concert, startling friends and foes alike. Auriel’s quirky habits include talking to plants (they never judge) and collecting oddly-natural objects.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title">Inspiration</h3>
                        <p>Auriel Vale was inspired by my past personal struggles and inner shadows. Like Auriel, I experienced slight anxiousness and uncertainty, often feeling overwhelmed in social situations. There were times when I felt like a stranger in a strange land, even when surrounded by friends and familiar places. This sense of disconnect and the need to find solace in the natural world were core aspects of Auriel's character.</p>
                        <p>Auriel's traits—trusting, distracted, impulsive, anxious, fickle, nature-loving, and eccentric—were crafted to reflect my own experiences and make them endearing. Her quirky behavior, such as talking to plants and being easily distracted by the beauty of nature, showcased how even the most unconventional traits could be charming and relatable.</p>
                        <p>Creating Auriel was a way to explore these characteristics in a positive light. Her journey of growth and self-discovery, learning to harness her impulsiveness, and overcoming her anxiety in urban settings mirrored my own path of personal development. Through Auriel, I wanted to show that our vulnerabilities and imperfections could become our greatest strengths when embraced and understood.</p>
                        <p>Auriel’s story of overcoming challenges and growing into her true self served as a reminder that even in moments of doubt and insecurity, there was potential for great resilience and transformation.</p>

                        <h3 class="section-title">Backstory</h3>
                        <p>Auriel Vale was born under a rare Eclipsed Moon in the Feywild, an event that marked her as special among the Whispering Guardians, the circle of Druids who trained her once her parents saw her astounding ability with nature. From a young age, Auriel showed a deep connection to nature and the fey creatures that inhabited the Feywild. Her eyes and hair changed with the seasons, much like her Eladrin bretheren, reflecting her bond with the natural world around her. Her upbringing in this magical, ever-changing realm instilled in her a profound respect for nature's beauty and unpredictability.</p>
                        <p>Auriel's trust in the creatures of nature was absolute. She often spoke to animals more than to other Eladrin, believing things of the more natural order had a raw honesty and authenticity in their hearts than humanity and those derived from humanity. This habit, while endearing, sometimes led her into dangerous situations, as she often forgot that not all natural beings had good intentions. Her impulsive nature, driven by the shifting seasons, mirrored the unpredictability of the Feywild, making her prone to acting on whims. This impulsiveness often got her into trouble, as she would rush into situations without fully considering the consequences.</p>
                        <p>Her deep-seated discomfort in urban settings contributed to her anxiety. Raised in the vast openness of the Feywild, the crowded, noisy cities of the mortal realm made her feel trapped and irritable. She longed for the peace and solitude of the wild, where she felt truly at home. This discomfort made it difficult for her to function in urban environments, increasing her anxiety and making her feel like an outsider.</p>
                        <p>Auriel's connection to nature also made her easily distracted by its beauty. She would often become captivated by a flower or a bird in the midst of important tasks, neglecting more pressing matters. This trait, while charming, could be frustrating for those who relied on her focus and attention. Her eccentric habit of planting seeds wherever she went, hoping to see a forest where there was none, showcased her love for nature but also her tendency to get lost in her thoughts and actions.</p>
                        <p>Auriel's upbringing among the Feywild’s creatures also made her somewhat eccentric. She carried seeds in her pockets, planting them in random places with the hope of seeing new forests spring up. When deep in thought, she would unconsciously levitate a few inches off the ground—a quirk attributed to her fey heritage. Her habit of adopting the mannerisms of animals she had recently spoken with often left other Eladrin confused. She often picked up her habits from Fae, and much of her interests based on seasons.</p>
                        <p>Auriel's life took a significant turn when she and her sprite friend, Thimble, stumbled upon a portal to the mortal realm. There, they encountered a human traveler entangled with a dark cult attempting to corrupt the Feywild. Auriel’s intervention during a cult ritual caused a surge of magic, creating a fragile link between the Feywild and the mortal world. This event was both a blessing and a curse, as it set her on a path to protect the balance between the two realms. It was there that Auriel fell out of the Feywilds, and into the terrifying new world that most know.</p>
                        <p>The Whispering Guardians, recognizing the importance of understanding and safeguarding this balance, blessed Auriel on a mission to the mortal realm. Her task was to uncover the threat to both worlds and preserve the natural harmony. This quest marked the beginning of her adventure as a druid navigating the complexities of both the Feywild and the mortal world.</p>
                        <p>In her travels, Auriel found allies in the fey creatures who shared her bond, fellow druids from different circles, and rangers who protected the wilds. Her connection to nature made her a beloved figure among these beings, who appreciated her dedication to the natural world. Her loyalty to her allies was unwavering, and she often used her knowledge of nature's secrets to heal and help, even if her methods seemed strange to others.</p>
                        <p>Auriel's enemies included corrupt developers, cultists of destructive deities, rival fey creatures, polluters, and necromancers. These adversaries threatened the balance she sought to protect, making her mission even more crucial. Despite her anxious nature and the challenges she faced, Auriel's love for nature and her determination to protect it made her a formidable druid and a cherished ally.</p>
                        <p>Auriel Vale's story is one of growth and self-discovery. Her journey from the mystical Feywild to the mortal realm, her struggles with anxiety and impulsiveness, and her unwavering dedication to protecting nature all reflect her unique character. Through her adventures, Auriel has become a symbol of resilience, demonstrating that even the most vulnerable and eccentric among us can be heroes.</p>
